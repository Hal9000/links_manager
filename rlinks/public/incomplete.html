<h2>Edit incomplete entries in a "chained" way</h2>

<pre>
Many links still have a missing category, a missing title or description,
or no tags.

I want to find these via query (easy part) and then present the user with
successive edit screens.

Logic flow:

Click the link
Update link --&gt; Submit --&gt; Show result --&gt; Next or Quit --&gt; ...

</pre>
