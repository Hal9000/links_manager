<h2>Search not implemented yet</h2>

<pre>
Simplest functionality: 
Search for 'string' in all links, searching the title, URL, and 
description. Maybe search categories and tags also??

Later, advanced functionality:
Search for links matching criteria -- 
  string is/isn't found in title, description, URL
  search within category or categories
  search by tag(s)
  Maybe even Boolean combinations of these??
